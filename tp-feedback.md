# TP Feedback for Team 19
                                        
**TP Grade**: A+
                                        
## Immersion Design
articulated design that targets specific user experiences that relates well to immersion concepts
                                        
## Immersion Implementation
implementation is clearly related to immersion design and works well
                                        
## Evaluation Method
appropriate data collection method was performed with good quantity and/or quality
                                        
## Evaluation Analysis
data was thoroughly and meticulously analysed to form conclusions leading to a meaningful articulation of future work
                                        
## Documentation
a comprehensive README (clear/detailed instructions and architecture) and a well-made video demo (well-scripted articulations with good footages)
                                        
## Software Engineering
minimal evidence of properly managed software development processes as a team
                                        
## Other feedback
Good expression of immersion design and clear articulation of how implementation relates to goals.

Good application of exact immersion constructs learnt from class to collect data. Decent attempts at summarizing the data for analysis as well. Really good quantity too.

Documentation - readme was sufficiently detailed and video was well-scripted
Software Engineering - no evidence of software processes provided other than high level role assignments and minimal task distribution seen in the different branches.
